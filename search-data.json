    "keywords": "Introduction the Common Language Runtime CLR Vance Morrison 2007 What the Common Language Runtime CLR put succinctly The Common Language Runtime CLR complete high level virtual machine designed support broad variety programming languages and interoperation among them Phew that was mouthful also and itself not very illuminating The statement above useful however because the first step taking the large and complicated piece software known the CLR http msdn microsoft com library 8bs2ecf4 aspx and grouping its features understandable way gives 000 foot view the runtime from which can understand the broad goals and purpose the runtime After understanding the CLR this high level easier look more deeply into sub components without much chance getting lost the details The CLR very rare Complete Programming Platform Every program has surprising number dependencies its runtime environment Most obviously the program written particular programming language but that only the first many assumptions programmer weaves into the program All interesting programs need some runtime library that allows them interact with the other resources the machine such user input disk files network communications etc The program also needs converted some way either interpretation compilation form that the native hardware can execute directly These dependencies program are numerous interdependent and diverse that implementers programming languages almost always defer other standards specify them For example the language does not specify the format executable Instead each compiler bound particular hardware architecture X86 and operating system environment Windows Linux Mac which describes the format the executable file format and specifies how will loaded Thus programmers don make executable but rather Windows X86 executable Power Mac executable While leveraging existing hardware and operating system standards usually good thing has the disadvantage tying the specification the level abstraction the existing standards For example common operating system today has the concept garbage collected heap Thus there way use existing standards describe interface that takes advantage garbage collection passing strings back and forth without worrying about who responsible for deleting them Similarly typical executable file format provides just enough information run program but not enough information for compiler bind other binaries the executable For example programs typically use standard library Windows called msvcrt dll which contains most the common functionality printf but the existence that library alone not enough Without the matching header files that along with stdio programmers can use the library Thus existing executable file format standards cannot used both describe file format that can run and specify other information binaries necessary make the program complete The CLR fixes problems like these defining very complete specification dotnet standards standardized ECMA containing the details you need for the COMPLETE lifecycle program from construction and binding through deployment and execution Thus among other things the CLR specifies aware virtual machine with its own instruction set called the Common Intermediate Language CIL used specify the primitive operations that programs perform This means the CLR not dependent particular type CPU rich meta data representation for program declarations types fields methods etc that compilers generating other executables have the information they need call functionality from outside file format that specifies exactly how lay the bits down file that you can properly speak CLR EXE that not tied particular operating system computer hardware The lifetime semantics loaded program the mechanism which one CLR EXE file can refer another CLR EXE and the rules how the runtime finds the referenced files execution time class library that leverages the features that the CLR provides garbage collection exceptions generic types give access both basic functionality integers strings arrays lists dictionaries well operating system services files network user interaction Multi language Support Defining specifying and implementing all these details huge undertaking which why complete abstractions like the CLR are very rare fact the vast majority such reasonably complete abstractions were built for single languages For example the Java runtime the Perl interpreter the early version the Visual Basic runtime offer similarly complete abstraction boundaries What distinguishes the CLR from these earlier efforts its multi language nature With the possible exception Visual Basic because leverages the COM object model the experience within the language often very good but interoperating with programs written other languages very difficult best Interoperation difficult because these languages can only communicate with foreign languages using the primitives provided the operating system Because the abstraction level low the operating system has concept garbage collected heap needlessly complicated techniques are necessary providing COMMON LANGUAGE RUNTIME the CLR allows languages communicate with each other with high level constructs collected structures easing the interoperation burden dramatically Because the runtime shared among many languages means that more resources can put into supporting well Building good debuggers and profilers for language lot work and thus they exist full featured form only for the most important programming languages Nevertheless because languages that are implemented the CLR can reuse this infrastructure the burden any particular language reduced substantially Perhaps even more important any language built the CLR immediately has access all the class libraries built top the CLR This large and growing body debugged and supported functionality huge reason why the CLR has been successful short the runtime complete specification the exact bits one has put file create and run program The virtual machine that runs these files high level appropriate for implementing broad class programming languages This virtual machine along with ever growing body class libraries that run that virtual machine what call the common language runtime CLR The Primary Goal the CLR Now that have basic idea what the CLR useful back just bit and understand the problem the runtime was meant solve very high level the runtime has only one goal The goal the CLR make programming easy This statement useful for two reasons First very useful guiding principle the runtime evolves For example fundamentally only simple things can easy adding user visible complexity the runtime should always viewed with suspicion More important than the cost benefit ratio feature its added exposed complexity weighted benefit over all scenarios ratio Ideally this ratio negative that the new feature reduces complexity removing restrictions generalizing existing special cases however more typically kept low minimizing the exposed complexity and maximizing the number scenarios which the feature adds value The second reason this goal important that ease use the fundamental reason for the CLR success The CLR not successful because faster smaller than writing native code fact well written native code often wins The CLR not successful because any particular feature supports like garbage collection platform independence object oriented programming versioning support The CLR successful because all those features well numerous others combine make programming significantly easier than would otherwise Some important but often overlooked ease use features include Simplified languages and Visual Basic are significantly simpler than dedication simplicity the class library only have one string type and immutable this greatly simplifies any API that uses strings Strong consistency the naming the class library requiring APIs use whole words and consistent naming conventions Great support the tool chain needed create application Visual Studio makes building CLR applications very simple and Intellisense makes finding the right types and methods create the application very easy this dedication ease use which goes hand hand with simplicity the user model that stands out the reason for the success the CLR Oddly some the most important ease use features are also the most boring For example any programming environment could apply consistent naming conventions yet actually doing across large class library quite lot work Often such efforts conflict with other goals such retaining compatibility with existing interfaces they run into significant logistical concerns such the cost renaming method across very large code base times like these that have remind ourselves about our number one overarching goal the runtime and ensure that are have our priorities straight reach that goal Fundamental Features the CLR The runtime has many features useful categorize them follows Fundamental features Features that have broad impact the design other features These include Garbage Collection Memory Safety and Type Safety High level support for programming languages Secondary features Features enabled the fundamental features that may not required many useful programs Program isolation with AppDomains Program Security and sandboxing Other Features Features that all runtime environments need but that not leverage the fundamental features the CLR Instead they are the result the desire create complete programming environment Among them are Versioning Debugging Profiling Interoperation The CLR Garbage Collector all the features that the CLR provides the garbage collector deserves special notice Garbage collection the common term for automatic memory reclamation garbage collected system user programs longer need invoke special operator delete memory Instead the runtime automatically keeps track all references memory the garbage collected heap and from time time will traverse these references find out which memory still reachable the program All other memory garbage and can reused for new allocations Garbage collection wonderful user feature because simplifies programming The most obvious simplification that most explicit delete operations are longer necessary While removing the delete operations important the real value the programmer bit more subtle Garbage collection simplifies interface design because you longer have carefully specify which side the interface responsible for deleting objects passed across the interface For example CLR interfaces simply return strings they don take string buffers and lengths This means they don have deal with the complexity what happens when the buffers are too small Thus garbage collection allows ALL interfaces the runtime simpler than they otherwise would Garbage collection eliminates whole class common user mistakes frightfully easy make mistakes concerning the lifetime particular object either deleting too soon leading memory corruption too late unreachable memory leaks Since typical program uses literally MILLIONS objects the probability for error quite high addition tracking down lifetime bugs very difficult especially the object referenced many other objects Making this class mistakes impossible avoids lot grief Still not the usefulness garbage collection that makes worthy special note here More important the simple requirement places the runtime itself Garbage collection requires ALL references the heap tracked While this very simple requirement fact has profound ramifications for the runtime you can imagine knowing where every pointer object every moment program execution can quite difficult have one mitigating factor though Technically this requirement only applies when actually needs happen thus theory don need know where all references are all the time but only the time practice however this mitigation doesn completely apply because another feature the CLR The CLR supports multiple concurrent threads execution with single process any time some other thread execution might perform allocation that requires garbage collection The exact sequence operations across concurrently executing threads non deterministic can tell exactly what one thread will doing when another thread requests allocation that will trigger Thus GCs can really happen any time Now the CLR does NOT need respond immediately another thread desire the CLR has little wiggle room and doesn need track references all points execution but does need enough places that can guarantee timely response the need caused allocation another thread What this means that the CLR needs track all references the heap almost all the time Since references may reside machine registers local variables statics other fields there quite bit track The most problematic these locations are machine registers and local variables because they are intimately related the actual execution user code Effectively what this means that the machine code that manipulates references has another requirement must track all the references that uses This implies some extra work for the compiler emit the instructions track the references learn more check out the Garbage Collector design document overview The Concept Managed Code Code that does the extra bookkeeping that can report all its live references almost all the time called managed code because managed the CLR Code that does not this called unmanaged code Thus all code that existed before the CLR unmanaged code and particular all operating system code unmanaged The stack unwinding problem Clearly because managed code needs the services the operating system there will times when managed code calls unmanaged code Similarly because the operating system originally started the managed code there are also times when unmanaged code calls into managed code Thus general you stop managed program arbitrary location the call stack will have mixture frames created managed code and frames created unmanaged code The stack frames for unmanaged code have requirements them over and above running the program particular there requirement that they can unwound runtime find their caller What this means that you stop program arbitrary place and happens unmanaged method there way general find who the caller was You can only this the debugger because extra information stored the symbolic information PDB file This information not guaranteed available which why you sometimes don get good stack traces debugger This quite problematic for managed code because any stack that can unwound might fact contain managed code frames which contain references that need reported Managed code has additional requirements not only must track all the references uses during its execution but must also able unwind its caller Additionally whenever there transition from managed code unmanaged code the reverse managed code must also additional bookkeeping make for the fact that unmanaged code does not know how unwind its stack frames Effectively managed code links together the parts the stack that contain managed frames Thus while still may impossible unwind the unmanaged stack frames without additional information will always possible find the chunks the stack that correspond managed code and enumerate the managed frames those chunks More recent platform ABIs application binary interfaces define conventions for encoding this information however there typically not strict requirement for all code follow them The World Managed Code The result that special bookkeeping needed every transition and from managed code Managed code effectively lives its own world where execution can enter leave unless the CLR knows about The two worlds are very real sense distinct from one another any point time the code the managed world the unmanaged world Moreover because the execution managed code specified CLR format with its Common Intermediate Language http download microsoft com download 733AD403 90B2 4064 A81E 01035A7FE13C 20Partition 20III pdf CIL and the CLR that converts run the native hardware the CLR has much more control over exactly what that execution does For example the CLR could change the meaning what means fetch field from object call function fact the CLR does exactly this support the ability create MarshalByReference objects These appear ordinary local objects but fact may exist another machine short the managed world the CLR has large number execution hooks that can use support powerful features which will explained more detail the coming sections addition there another important ramification managed code that may not obvious the unmanaged world pointers are not allowed since they can tracked and there bookkeeping cost associated with transitioning from managed unmanaged code What this means that while you can call arbitrary unmanaged functions from managed code often not pleasant Unmanaged methods don use objects their arguments and return types which means that any objects object handles that those unmanaged functions create and use need explicitly deallocated This quite unfortunate Because these APIs can take advantage CLR functionality such exceptions inheritance they tend have mismatched user experience compared how the interfaces would have been designed managed code The result this that unmanaged interfaces are almost always wrapped before being exposed managed code developers For example when accessing files you don use the Win32 CreateFile functions provided the operating system but rather the managed System File class that wraps this functionality fact extremely rare that unmanaged functionality exposed users directly While this wrapping may seem bad some way more code that does not seem much fact good because actually adds quite bit value Remember was always possible expose the unmanaged interfaces directly chose wrap the functionality Why Because the overarching goal the runtime make programming easy and typically the unmanaged functions are not easy enough Most often unmanaged interfaces are not designed with ease use mind but rather are tuned for completeness Anyone looking the arguments CreateFile CreateProcess would hard pressed characterize them easy Luckily the functionality gets facelift when enters the managed world and while this makeover often very low tech requiring nothing more complex than renaming simplification and organizing the functionality also profoundly useful One the very important documents created for the CLR the Framework Design Guidelines http msdn microsoft com library ms229042 aspx This 800 page document details best practices making new managed class libraries Thus have now seen that managed code which intimately involved with the CLR differs from unmanaged code two important ways High Tech The code lives distinct world where the CLR controls most aspects program execution very fine level potentially individual instructions and the CLR detects when execution enters and exits managed code This enables wide variety useful features Low Tech The fact that there transition cost when going from managed unmanaged code well the fact that unmanaged code cannot use objects encourages the practice wrapping most unmanaged code managed façade This means interfaces can get facelift simplify them and conform uniform set naming and design guidelines that produce level consistency and discoverability that could have existed the unmanaged world but does not Both these characteristics are very important the success managed code Memory and Type Safety One the less obvious but quite far reaching features that garbage collector enables that memory safety The invariant memory safety very simple program memory safe accesses only memory that has been allocated and not freed This simply means that you don have wild dangling pointers that are pointing random locations more precisely memory that was freed prematurely Clearly memory safety property want all programs have Dangling pointers are always bugs and tracking them down often quite difficult necessary provide memory safety guarantees One can quickly see how garbage collector helps ensuring memory safety because removes the possibility that users will prematurely free memory and thus access memory that was not properly allocated What may not obvious that you want guarantee memory safety that make impossible for programmers create memory unsafe programs practically speaking you can avoid having garbage collector The reason for this that non trivial programs need heap style dynamic memory allocations where the lifetime the objects essentially under arbitrary program control unlike stack allocated statically allocated memory which has highly constrained allocation protocol such unconstrained environment the problem determining whether particular explicit delete statement correct becomes impossible predict program analysis Effectively the only way you have determine delete correct check runtime This exactly what does checks see memory still live Thus for any programs that need heap style memory allocations you want guarantee memory safety you need While necessary ensure memory safety not sufficient The will not prevent the program from indexing off the end array accessing field off the end object possible you compute the field address using base and offset computation However prevent these cases then can indeed make impossible for programmer create memory unsafe programs While the common intermediate language http download microsoft com download 733AD403 90B2 4064 A81E 01035A7FE13C 20Partition 20III pdf CIL does have operators that can fetch and set arbitrary memory and thus violate memory safety also has the following memory safe operators and the CLR strongly encourages their use most programming Field fetch operators LDFLD STFLD LDFLDA that fetch read set and take the address field name Array fetch operators LDELEM STELEM LDELEMA that fetch set and take the address array element index All arrays include tag specifying their length This facilitates automatic bounds check before each access using these operators instead the lower level and unsafe memory fetch operators user code well avoiding other unsafe CIL http download microsoft com download 733AD403 90B2 4064 A81E 01035A7FE13C 20Partition 20III pdf operators those that allow you jump arbitrary and thus possibly bad locations one could imagine building system that memory safe but nothing more The CLR does not this however Instead the CLR enforces stronger invariant type safety For type safety conceptually each memory allocation associated with type All operators that act memory locations are also conceptually tagged with the type for which they are valid Type safety then requires that memory tagged with particular type can only undergo operations allowed for that type Not only does this ensure memory safety dangling pointers also allows additional guarantees for each individual type One the most important these type specific guarantees that the visibility attributes associated with type and particular with fields are enforced Thus field declared private accessible only the methods the type then that privacy will indeed respected all other type safe code For example particular type might declare count field that represents the count items table Assuming the fields for the count and the table are private and assuming that the only code that updates them updates them together there now strong guarantee across all type safe code that the count and the number items the table are indeed sync When reasoning about programs programmers use the concept type safety all the time whether they know not The CLR elevates type safety from being simply programming language compiler convention something that can strictly enforced run time Verifiable Code Enforcing Memory and Type Safety Conceptually enforce type safety every operation that the program performs has checked ensure that operating memory that was typed way that compatible with the operation While the system could this all runtime would very slow Instead the CLR has the concept CIL http download microsoft com download 733AD403 90B2 4064 A81E 01035A7FE13C 20Partition 20III pdf verification where static analysis done the CIL http download microsoft com download 733AD403 90B2 4064 A81E 01035A7FE13C 20Partition 20III pdf before the code run confirm that most operations are indeed type safe Only when this static analysis can complete job are runtime checks necessary practice the number run time checks needed actually very small They include the following operations Casting pointer base type pointer derived type the opposite direction can checked statically Array bounds checks just saw for memory safety Assigning element array pointers new pointer value This particular check only required because CLR arrays have liberal casting rules more that later Note that the need these checks places requirements the runtime particular All memory the heap must tagged with its type the casting operator can implemented This type information must available runtime and must rich enough determine casts are valid the runtime needs know the inheritance hierarchy fact the first field every object the heap points runtime data structure that represents its type All arrays must also have their size for bounds checking Arrays must have complete type information about their element type Luckily the most expensive requirement tagging each heap item was something that was already necessary support garbage collection the needs know what fields every object contain references that need scanned the additional cost provide type safety low Thus verifying the CIL http download microsoft com download 733AD403 90B2 4064 A81E 01035A7FE13C 20Partition 20III pdf the code and doing few run time checks the CLR can ensure type safety and memory safety Nevertheless this extra safety exacts price programming flexibility While the CLR does have general memory fetch operators these operators can only used very constrained ways for the code verifiable particular all pointer arithmetic will fail verification today Thus many classic conventions cannot used verifiable code you must use arrays instead While this constrains programming bit really not bad arrays are quite powerful and the benefits far fewer nasty bugs are quite real The CLR strongly encourages the use verifiable type safe code Even there are times mostly when dealing with unmanaged code that unverifiable programming needed The CLR allows this but the best practice here try confine this unsafe code much possible Typical programs have only very small fraction their code that needs unsafe and the rest can type safe High Level Features Supporting garbage collection had profound effect the runtime because requires that all code must support extra bookkeeping The desire for type safety also had profound effect requiring that the description the program the CIL http download microsoft com download 733AD403 90B2 4064 A81E 01035A7FE13C 20Partition 20III pdf high level where fields and methods have detailed type information The desire for type safety also forces the CIL http download microsoft com download 733AD403 90B2 4064 A81E 01035A7FE13C 20Partition 20III pdf support other high level programming constructs that are type safe Expressing these constructs type safe manner also requires runtime support The two most important these high level features are used support two essential elements object oriented programming inheritance and virtual call dispatch Object Oriented Programming Inheritance relatively simple mechanical sense The basic idea that the fields type derived are superset the fields type base and derived lays out its fields the fields base come first then any code that expects pointer instance base can given pointer instance derived and the code will just work Thus type derived said inherit from base meaning that can used anywhere base can used Code becomes polymorphic because the same code can used many distinct types Because the runtime needs know what type coercions are possible the runtime must formalize the way inheritance specified can validate type safety Virtual call dispatch generalizes inheritance polymorphism allows base types declare methods that will overridden derived types Code that uses variables type base can expect that calls virtual methods will dispatched the correct overridden method based the actual type the object run time While such run time dispatch logic could have been implemented using primitive CIL http download microsoft com download 733AD403 90B2 4064 A81E 01035A7FE13C 20Partition 20III pdf instructions without direct support the runtime would have suffered from two important disadvantages would not type safe mistakes the dispatch table are catastrophic errors Each object oriented language would likely implement slightly different way implementing its virtual dispatch logic result interoperability among languages would suffer one language could not inherit from base type implemented another language For this reason the CLR has direct support for basic object oriented features the degree possible the CLR tried make its model inheritance language neutral the sense that different languages might still share the same inheritance hierarchy Unfortunately that was not always possible particular multiple inheritance can implemented many different ways The CLR chose not support multiple inheritance types with fields but does support multiple inheritance from special types called interfaces that are constrained not have fields important keep mind that while the runtime supports these object oriented concepts does not require their use Languages without the concept inheritance functional languages simply don use these facilities Value Types and Boxing profound yet subtle aspect object oriented programming the concept object identity the notion that objects allocated separate allocation calls can distinguished even all their field values are identical Object identity strongly related the fact that objects are accessed reference pointer rather than value two variables hold the same object their pointers address the same memory then updates one the variables will affect the other variable Unfortunately the concept object identity not good semantic match for all types particular programmers don generally think integers objects the number was allocated two different places programmers generally want consider those two items equal and certainly don want updates one those instances affecting the other fact broad class programming languages called functional languages avoid object identity and reference semantics altogether While possible have pure object oriented system where everything including integers object Smalltalk does this certain amount implementation gymnastics necessary undo this uniformity get efficient implementation Other languages Perl Java JavaScript take pragmatic view and treat some types like integers value and others reference The CLR also chose mixed model but unlike the others allowed user defined value types The key characteristics value types are Each local variable field array element value type has distinct copy the data the value When one variable field array element assigned another the value copied Equality always defined only terms the data the variable not its location Each value type also has corresponding reference type which has only one implicit unnamed field This called its boxed value Boxed value types can participate inheritance and have object identity although using the object identity boxed value type strongly discouraged Value types very closely model the and notion struct class Like you can have pointers value types but the pointers are type distinct from the type the struct Exceptions Another high level programming construct that the CLR directly supports exceptions Exceptions are language feature that allow programmers throw arbitrary object the point that failure occurs When object thrown the runtime searches the call stack for method that declares that can catch the exception such catch declaration found execution continues from that point The usefulness exceptions that they avoid the very common mistake not checking called method fails Given that exceptions help avoid programmer mistakes thus making programming easier not surprising that the CLR supports them aside while exceptions avoid one common error not checking for failure they not prevent another restoring data structures consistent state the event failure This means that after exception caught difficult general know continuing execution will cause additional errors caused the first failure This area where the CLR likely add value the future Even currently implemented however exceptions are great step forward just need further Parameterized Types Generics Previous version the CLR the only parameterized types were arrays All other containers such hash tables lists queues etc all operated generic Object type The inability create List Dictionary certainly had negative performance effect because value types needed boxed entry collection and explicit casting was needed element fetch Nevertheless that not the overriding reason for adding parameterized types the CLR The main reason that parameterized types make programming easier The reason for this subtle The easiest way see the effect imagine what class library would look like all types were replaced with generic Object type This effect not unlike what happens dynamically typed languages like JavaScript such world there are simply far more ways for programmer make incorrect but type safe programs the parameter for that method supposed list string integer any the above longer obvious from looking the method signature Worse when method returns Object what other methods can accept parameter Typical frameworks have hundreds methods they all take parameters type Object becomes very difficult determine which Object instances are valid for the operations the method will perform short strong typing help programmer express his intent more clearly and allows tools the compiler enforce his intent This results big productivity boost These benefits not disappear just because the type gets put into List Dictionary clearly parameterized types have value The only real question whether parameterized types are best thought language specific feature which compiled out the time CIL generated whether this feature should have first class support the runtime Either implementation certainly possible The CLR team chose first class support because without parameterized types would implemented different ways different languages This would imply that interoperability would cumbersome best addition expressing programmer intent for parameterized types most valuable the interface class library the CLR did not officially support parameterized types then class libraries could not use them and important usability feature would lost Programs Data Reflection APIs The fundamentals the CLR are garbage collection type safety and high level language features These basic characteristics forced the specification the program the CIL fairly high level Once this data existed run time something not true for programs became obvious that would also valuable expose this rich data end programmers This idea resulted the creation the System Reflection interfaces called because they allow the program look reflect upon itself This interface allows you explore almost all aspects program what types has the inheritance relationship and what methods and fields are present fact little information lost that very good decompilers for managed code are possible NET Reflector http www red gate com products reflector While those concerned with intellectual property protection are aghast this capability which can fixed purposefully destroying information through operation called obfuscating the program the fact that possible testament the richness the information available run time managed code addition simply inspecting programs run time also possible perform operations them invoke methods set fields etc and perhaps most powerfully generate code from scratch run time System Reflection Emit fact the runtime libraries use this capability create specialized code for matching strings System Text RegularExpressions and generate code for serializing objects store file send across the network Capabilities like this were simply infeasible before you would have write compiler but thanks the runtime are well within reach many more programming problems While reflection capabilities are indeed powerful that power should used with care Reflection usually significantly slower than its statically compiled counterparts More importantly self referential systems are inherently harder understand This means that powerful features such Reflection Reflection Emit should only used when the value clear and substantial Other Features The last grouping runtime features are those that are not related the fundamental architecture the CLR type safety high level specification but nevertheless fill important needs any complete runtime system Interoperation with Unmanaged Code Managed code needs able use functionality implemented unmanaged code There are two main flavors interoperation First the ability simply call unmanaged functions this called Platform Invoke PINVOKE Unmanaged code also has object oriented model interoperation called COM component object model which has more structure than hoc method calls Since both COM and the CLR have models for objects and other conventions how errors are handled lifetime objects etc the CLR can better job interoperating with COM code has special support Ahead time Compilation the CLR model managed code distributed CIL not native code Translation native code occurs run time optimization the native code that generated from the CIL can saved file using tool called crossgen similar NET Framework NGEN tool This avoids large amounts compilation time run time and very important because the class library large Threading The CLR fully anticipated the need support multi threaded programs managed code From the start the CLR libraries contained the System Threading Thread class which wrapper over the operating system notion thread execution However because just wrapper over the operating system thread creating System Threading Thread relatively expensive takes milliseconds start While this fine for many operations one style programming creates very small work items taking only tens milliseconds This very common server code each task serving just one web page code that tries take advantage multi processors multi core sort algorithm support this the CLR has the notion ThreadPool which allows WorkItems queued this scheme the CLR responsible for creating the necessary threads the work While the CLR does expose the ThreadPool directly the System Threading Threadpool class the preferred mechanism use the Task Parallel Library https msdn microsoft com library dd460717 110 aspx which adds additional support for very common forms concurrency control From implementation perspective the important innovation the ThreadPool that responsible for ensuring that the optimal number threads are used dispatch the work The CLR does this using feedback system where monitors the throughput rate and the number threads and adjusts the number threads maximize the throughput This very nice because now programmers can think mostly terms exposing parallelism that creating work items rather than the more subtle question determining the right amount parallelism which depends the workload and the hardware which the program run Summary and Resources Phew The runtime does lot has taken many pages just describe some the features the runtime without even starting talk about internal details The hope however that this introduction will provide useful framework for deeper understanding those internal details The basic outline this framework The Runtime complete framework for supporting programming languages The Runtime goal make programming easy The Fundamental features the runtime are

how NET works Managed Code managed code Common Type System common type system The runtime common language runtime Base Class Library framework libraries stroll through NET any mature and advanced application development framework NET has many powerful features that make the developer job easier and aim make writing code more powerful and expressive This section will outline the basics the most salient features and provide pointers more detailed discussions where needed After finishing this stroll you should have enough information able read the samples our GitHub repos well other code and understand what going Automatic memory management Type safety The managed compiler Delegates and lambdas Generic Types Generics LINQ Asynchronous support Dynamic language features Code contracts Native interoperability Automatic memory management Garbage collection the most well known NET features Developers not need actively manage memory although there are affordances provide more information the garbage collector includes the new keyword allocate memory terms particular type and the using keyword provide scope for the usage the object The operates lazy approach memory management preferring application throughput the immediate collection memory The following two lines both allocate memory csharp var title NET Primer var list new List string There analogous keyword allocate memory allocation happens automatically when the garbage collector reclaims the memory through its scheduled running Method variables normally out scope once method completes which point they can collected However you can indicate the that particular object out scope sooner than method exit using the using statement csharp using FileStream stream GetFileStream context operations the stream Once the using block completes the will know that the stream object the example above free collected and its memory reclaimed One the less obvious but quite far reaching features that garbage collector enables memory safety The invariant memory safety very simple program memory safe accesses only memory that has been allocated and not freed Dangling pointers are always bugs and tracking them down often quite difficult The NET runtime provides additional services complete the promise memory safety not naturally offered ensures that programs not index off the end array accessing

Generic Types Generics Generic types generics are feature that was added NET Framework short generics allow the programmer introduce type parameter when designing their classes that will allow the client code the users the type specify the exact type use place the type parameter Generics were added order help programmers implement generic data structures Before their arrival order for say List type generic would have work with elements that were type object This would have various performance well semantic problems not mention possible subtle runtime errors The most notorious the latter when data structure contains for instance both integers and strings and InvalidCastException thrown working with the list members The below sample shows basic program running using instance List types csharp using System using System Collections Generic namespace GenericsSampleShort public static void Main string args List string the client way specifying the actual type for the type parameter List string listOfStrings new List string First Second Third listOfStrings can accept only strings both read and write listOfStrings Add Fourth Below will throw compile time error since the type parameter specifies this list containing only strings listOfStrings Add Read more about the generics document Async Programming Async first class concept within NET with async support the runtime the framework libraries and various NET languages Async based off the Task concept which encapsulates set operations completed Tasks are distinct from threads and may not rely threads require CPU time much all particularly for bound tasks TODO Elaborate Task concept includes special treatment for async including the special keyword await for managing tasks The following example demonstrates calling web endpoint async operation csharp string url http someUrl HttpClient client new HttpClient string json await client GetStringAsync url The call client GetStringAsync url does not block but instead immediately yields returning Task Computation resumes and the call returns the requested string when the network activity has completed Language Integrated Query LINQ NET programs typically operate some form data The data can database resident the form objects sometimes called POCOs for Plain Old CLR Objects LINQ provides language integrated uniform query model over data independent the source Linq providers bridge the gap between the uniform query model and the form the data such SQL Server tables XML documents standard collections like List and more The follow examples demonstrate various uses LINQ query different forms data TODO finish the section link more detailed document Dynamic language features TODO finish section Code contracts TODO finish section Native Interoperability NET provides low level access native APIs via the platform invoke Invoke facility enables mapping NET types native types which the NET runtime marshalls before calling the native API TODO Examples Higher level native interop can established with Invoke The COM and WinRT interop systems the CLR are both built top Invoke The Java and Objective interop systems provided Xamarin top Mono are fundamentally the same Unsafe Code The CLR enables the ability acccess native memory and pointer arithmetic These operations are needed for some algortithms and for calling some native APIs The use these capabilities discouraged since you longer get the benefit verifiability nor will your code allowed run all environments The best practice confine unsafe code much possible and that the vast majority code type safe TODO Examples Notes The term NET runtime used throughout the document accomodate for the multiple implementations NET such CLR Mono IL2CPP and others The more specific names are only used needed This document not intended historical nature but describe the NET platform now isn important whether NET feature has always been available was only recently introduced only that important

part their analysis the compiler may produce set diagnostics covering everything from syntax semantic and definite assignment errors various warnings and informational diagnostics The Compiler API layer exposes diagnostics through extensible API allowing for user defined analyzers plugged into Compilation and user defined diagnostics such those produced tools like StyleCop FxCop produced alongside compiler defined diagnostics Producing diagnostics this way has the benefit integrating naturally with tools such MSBuild and Visual Studio which depend diagnostics for experiences such halting build based policy and showing live squiggles the editor and suggesting code fixes Scripting APIs part the compiler layer the team prototyped hosting scripting APIs for executing code snippets and accumulating runtime execution context The REPL used these APIs but neither the REPL nor the Scripting APIs are part the NET Compiler Platform project currently The team reviewing these designs before introducing these components Workspaces APIs The Workspaces layer contains the Workspace API which the starting point for doing code analysis and refactoring over entire solutions assists you organizing all the information about the projects solution into single object model offering you direct access the compiler layer object models without needing parse files configure options manage project project dependencies addition the Workspaces layer surfaces set commonly used APIs used when implementing code analysis and refactoring tools that function within host environment like the Visual Studio IDE such the Find All References Formatting and Code Generation APIs This layer has dependencies Visual Studio components Working with Syntax The most fundamental data structure exposed the Compiler APIs the syntax tree These trees represent the lexical and syntactic structure source code They serve two important purposes allow tools such IDE add ins code analysis tools and refactorings see and process the syntactic structure source code user project enable tools such refactorings and IDE create modify and rearrange source code natural manner without having use direct text edits creating and manipulating trees tools can easily create and rearrange source code Syntax Trees Syntax trees are the primary structure used for compilation code analysis binding refactoring IDE features and code generation part the source code understood without first being identified and categorized into one many well known structural language elements Syntax trees have three key attributes The first attribute that syntax trees hold all the source information full fidelity This means that the syntax tree contains every piece information found the source text every grammatical construct every lexical token and everything else between including whitespace comments and preprocessor directives For example each literal mentioned the source represented exactly was typed The syntax trees also represent errors source code when the program incomplete malformed representing skipped missing tokens the syntax tree This enables the second attribute syntax trees syntax tree obtained from the parser completely round trippable back the text was parsed from From any syntax node possible get the text representation the sub tree rooted that node This means that syntax trees can used way construct and edit source text creating tree you have implication created the equivalent text and editing syntax tree making new tree out changes existing tree you have effectively edited the text The third attribute syntax trees that they are immutable and thread safe This means that after tree obtained snapshot the current state the code and never changes This allows multiple users interact with the same syntax tree the same time different threads without locking duplication Because the trees are immutable and modifications can made directly tree factory methods help create and modify syntax trees creating additional snapshots the tree The trees are efficient the way they reuse underlying nodes the new version can rebuilt fast and with little extra memory syntax tree literally tree data structure where non terminal structural elements parent other elements Each syntax tree made nodes tokens and trivia Syntax Nodes Syntax nodes are one the primary elements syntax trees These nodes represent syntactic constructs such declarations statements clauses and expressions Each category syntax nodes represented separate class derived from SyntaxNode The set node classes not extensible All syntax nodes are non terminal nodes the syntax tree which means they always have other nodes and tokens children child another node each node has parent node that can accessed through the Parent property Because nodes and trees are immutable the parent node never changes The root the tree has null parent Each node has ChildNodes method which returns list child nodes sequential order based its position the source text This list does not contain tokens Each node also has collection Descendant methods such DescendantNodes DescendantTokens DescendantTrivia that represent list all the nodes tokens trivia that exist the sub tree rooted that node addition each syntax node subclass exposes all the same children through strongly typed properties For example BinaryExpressionSyntax node class has three additional properties specific binary operators Left OperatorToken and Right The type Left and Right ExpressionSyntax and the type OperatorToken SyntaxToken Some syntax nodes have optional children For example IfStatementSyntax has optional ElseClauseSyntax the child not present the property returns null Syntax Tokens Syntax tokens are the terminals the language grammar representing the smallest syntactic fragments the code They are never parents other nodes tokens Syntax tokens consist keywords identifiers literals and punctuation For efficiency purposes the SyntaxToken type CLR value type Therefore unlike syntax nodes there only one structure for all kinds tokens with mix properties that have meaning depending the kind token that being represented For example integer literal token represents numeric value addition the raw source text the token spans the literal token has Value property that tells you the exact decoded integer value This property typed Object because may one many primitive types The ValueText property tells you the same information the Value property however this property always typed String identifier source text may include Unicode escape characters yet the syntax the escape sequence itself not considered part the identifier name although the raw text spanned the token does include the escape sequence the ValueText property does not Instead includes the Unicode characters identified the escape Syntax Trivia Syntax trivia represent the parts the source text that are largely insignificant for normal understanding the code such whitespace comments and preprocessor directives Because trivia are not part the normal language syntax and can appear anywhere between any two tokens they are not included the syntax tree child node Yet because they are important when implementing feature like refactoring and maintain full fidelity with the source text they exist part the syntax tree You can access trivia inspecting token LeadingTrivia TrailingTrivia collections When source text parsed sequences trivia are associated with tokens general token owns any trivia after the same line the next token Any trivia after that line associated with the following token The first token the source file gets all the initial trivia and the last sequence trivia the file tacked onto the end file token which otherwise has zero width Unlike syntax nodes and tokens syntax trivia not have parents Yet because they are part the tree and each associated with single token you may access the token associated with using the Token property Like syntax tokens trivia are value types The single SyntaxTrivia type used describe all kinds trivia Spans Each node token trivia knows its position within the source text and the number characters consists text position represented bit integer which zero based Unicode character index TextSpan object the beginning position and count characters both represented integers TextSpan has zero length refers location between two characters Each node has two TextSpan properties Span and FullSpan The Span property the text span from the start the first token the node sub tree the end the last token This span does not include any leading trailing trivia The FullSpan property the text span that includes the node normal span plus the span any leading trailing trivia For example sourceCode this bad throw new Exception Not right better exception The statement node inside the block has span indicated the single vertical bars includes the characters throw new Exception Not right The full span indicated the double vertical bars includes the same characters the span and the characters associated with the leading and trailing trivia Kinds Each node token trivia has RawKind property type System Int32 that identifies the exact syntax element represented This value can cast language specific enumeration each language has single SyntaxKind enumeration that lists all the possible nodes tokens and trivia elements the grammar This conversion can done automatically accessing the CSharpSyntaxKind VisualBasicSyntaxKind extension methods The RawKind property allows for easy disambiguation syntax node types that share the same node class For tokens and trivia this property the only way distinguish one type element from another For example single BinaryExpressionSyntax class has Left OperatorToken and Right children The Kind property distinguishes whether AddExpression SubtractExpression MultiplyExpression kind syntax node Errors Even when the source text contains syntax errors full syntax tree that round trippable the source exposed When the parser encounters code that does not conform the defined syntax the language uses one two techniques create syntax tree First the parser expects particular kind token but does not find may insert missing token into the syntax tree the location that the token was expected missing token represents the actual token that was expected but has empty span and its IsMissing property returns true Second the parser may skip tokens until finds one where can continue parsing this case the skipped tokens that were skipped are attached trivia node with the kind SkippedTokens Working with Semantics Syntax trees represent the lexical and syntactic structure source code Although this information alone enough describe all the declarations and logic the source not enough information identify what being referenced For example many types fields methods and local variables with the same name may spread throughout the source Although each these uniquely different determining which one identifier actually refers often requires deep understanding the language rules There are program elements represented source code and programs can also refer previously compiled libraries packaged assembly files Although source code available for assemblies and therefore syntax nodes trees programs can still refer elements inside them addition syntactic model the source code semantic model encapsulates the language rules giving you easy way make these distinctions Compilation compilation representation everything needed compile Visual Basic program which includes all the assembly references compiler options and source files Because all this information one place the elements contained the source code can described more detail The compilation represents each declared type member variable symbol The compilation contains variety methods that help you find and relate the symbols that have either been declared the source code imported metadata from assembly Similar syntax trees compilations are immutable After you create compilation cannot changed you anyone else you might sharing with However you can create new compilation from existing compilation specifying change you For example you might create compilation that the same every way existing compilation except may include additional source file assembly reference Symbols symbol represents distinct element declared the source code imported from assembly metadata Every namespace type method property field event parameter local variable represented symbol variety methods and properties the Compilation type help you find symbols For example you can find symbol for declared type its common metadata name You can also access the entire symbol table tree symbols rooted the global namespace Symbols also contain additional information that the compiler determined from the source metadata such other referenced symbols Each kind symbol represented separate interface derived from ISymbol each with its own methods and properties detailing the information the compiler has gathered Many these properties directly reference other symbols For example the ReturnType property the IMethodSymbol class tells you the actual type symbol that the method declaration referenced Symbols present common representation namespaces types and members between source code and metadata For example method that was declared source code and method that was imported from metadata are both represented IMethodSymbol with the same properties Symbols are similar concept the CLR type system represented the System Reflection API yet they are richer that they model more than just types Namespaces local variables and labels are all symbols addition symbols are representation language concepts not CLR concepts There lot overlap but there are many meaningful distinctions well For instance iterator method Visual Basic single symbol However when the iterator method translated CLR metadata type and multiple methods Semantic Model semantic model represents all the semantic information for single source file You can use discover the following The symbols referenced specific location source The resultant type any expression All diagnostics which are errors and warnings How variables flow and out regions source The answers more speculative questions Working with Workspace The Workspaces layer the starting point for doing code analysis and refactoring over entire solutions Within this layer the Workspace API assists you organizing all the information about the projects solution into single object model offering you direct access compiler layer object models like source text syntax trees semantic models and compilations without needing parse files configure options manage inter project dependencies Host environments like IDE provide workspace for you corresponding the open solution also possible use this model outside IDE simply loading solution file Workspace workspace active representation your solution collection projects each with collection documents workspace typically tied host environment that constantly changing user types manipulates properties The workspace provides access the current model the solution When change the host environment occurs the workspace fires corresponding events and the CurrentSolution property updated For example when the user types text editor corresponding one the source documents the workspace uses event signal that the overall model the solution has changed and which document was modified You can then react those changes analyzing the new model for correctness highlighting areas significance making suggestion for code change You can also create stand alone workspaces that are disconnected from the host environment used application that has host environment Solutions Projects Documents Although workspace may change every time key pressed you can work with the model the solution isolation solution immutable model the projects and documents This means that the model can shared without locking duplication After you obtain solution instance from the Workspace CurrentSolution property that instance will never change However like with syntax trees and compilations you can modify solutions constructing new instances based existing solutions and specific changes get the workspace reflect your changes you must explicitly apply the changed solution back the workspace project part the overall immutable solution model represents all the source code documents parse and compilation options and both assembly and project project references From project you can access the corresponding compilation without needing determine project dependencies parse any source files document also part the overall immutable solution model document represents single source file from which you can access the text the file the syntax tree and the semantic model The following diagram representation how the Workspace relates the host environment tools and how edits are made image images workspace obj relations png Summary The NET Compiler Platform Roslyn exposes set Compiler APIs and Workspaces APIs that provides rich information about your source code and that has full fidelity with the and Visual Basic languages The transition compilers platform dramatically lowers the barrier entry for creating code focused tools and applications creates many opportunities for innovation areas such meta programming code generation and transformation interactive use the and languages and embedding and domain specific languages"
