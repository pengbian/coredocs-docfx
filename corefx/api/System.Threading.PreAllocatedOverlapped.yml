  summary: >-
    Initializes a new instance of the [System.Threading.PreAllocatedOverlapped](System.Threading.PreAllocatedOverlapped.yml) class, specifying

    a delegate that is invoked when each asynchronous I/O operation is complete, a user-provided

    object providing context, and managed objects that serve as buffers.
  remarks: >-
    The new <see cref="T:System.Threading.PreAllocatedOverlapped" /> instance can be passed to

    <see cref="M:System.Threading.ThreadPoolBoundHandle.AllocateNativeOverlapped(System.Threading.PreAllocatedOverlapped)" />, to produce

    a <see cref="T:System.Threading.NativeOverlapped" /> instance that can be passed to the operating system in overlapped

    I/O operations.  A single <see cref="T:System.Threading.PreAllocatedOverlapped" /> instance can only be used for

    a single native I/O operation at a time.  However, the state stored in the <see cref="T:System.Threading.PreAllocatedOverlapped" />

    instance can be reused for subsequent native operations.

    <note>

    The buffers specified in <paramref name="pinData" /> are pinned until <see cref="M:System.Threading.PreAllocatedOverlapped.Dispose" /> is called.
